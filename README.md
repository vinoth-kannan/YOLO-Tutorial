# YOLO-Tutorial

You Only Look Once (YOLO) is one of the most popular model architectures and object detection algorithms. It uses one of the best neural network architectures to produce high accuracy and overall processing speed, which is the main reason for its popularity. If we search Google for object detection algorithms, the first result will be related to the YOLO model.

YOLO algorithm aims to predict a class of an object and the bounding box that defines the object location on the input image. It recognizes each bounding box using four numbers:

Center of the bounding box ((b_{x}, b_{y}))
Width of the box (b_{w})
Height of the box (b_{h})
In addition to that, YOLO predicts the corresponding number c for the predicted class as well as the probability of the prediction (P_{c})
